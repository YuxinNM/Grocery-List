# My Personal Project

## What will the application do?
The application will be a budget and nutrition planner for grocery shopping (food). 
Users can enter each grocery item they purchased or plan to purchase with:
- name
- price
- a category out of the five main groups the food belongs to or "others" if they do not belong to any,
e.g. vegetables, fruits, grains, dairy, proteins, or others. 

With the given entries, the application will 
- calculate the total amount of money users have spent or plan to spend.
- generate a pie chart based on the distribution of the indicated food groups (based on entries)
- generate a recommended pie chart beside the user's pie chart for comparison (pre-designed, based on the government health website)

If the user removes or adds items, the total amount of money and the pie chart based on entries will be updated accordingly.

## Who will use it?
- People who wish to keep track of &/ budget their grocery expenses
- People who need guidance on nutrition for grocery shopping
- People who like to plan a lot

## Why is this project of interest to you?
I started grocery shopping recently. As a huge planner, I like writing my grocery list beforehand, yet I still shop for unexpected groceries. I also realize some unbalanced nutrition. And I never have a sense of my expenses except the moment I pay. It would just be nice to have everything in the same place and have some real-time reports. This application aims to allow that and generate a **real-time summary for expenses and nutrition** before checking out. It would be healthier and more budget-friendly. While carrying a laptop and using the application in real-time may not be practical, it can pave the way for the transition to mobile applications. It would also be a great tool to **keep track of expenses and nutrition after shopping so we can adjust and balance nutrition next time**.
