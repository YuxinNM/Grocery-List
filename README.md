# My Personal Project

## What will the application do?
The application will be a budget and nutrition planner for grocery shopping. 
Users can enter each grocery item they purchased or plan to purchase with:
- name
- price
- a category out of the 5 main groups the food belongs to or "others" if they do not belong to any,
e.g. vegetables, friuts, grains, dairy, proteins, or others. 

With the given entries, the application will 
- calculate the total amount of money users spent or they plan to spend.
- generate a pie chart based on the distribution of the indicated food groups (based on entries)
- generate a recomended pie chart beside the user's pie chart for comparison (pre-designed, based on government health website)

If changes are made by the users, e.g. the user removed or added items, then, the total amount of money and the pie chart based on entries will be changed accordingly.

## Who will use it?
- People who wish to keep track of &/ budget their grocery expenses
- People who need guidance on nutrition for grocery shopping
- People who like to plan a lot

## Why is this project of interest to you?
I started grocery shopping recently. As a huge planner, I would write down my grocery list before going but often times, I ended up with a lot of unexpected groceries. I also realize some unbalanced nutrition and I never have a sense of my expenses except the moment I pay. It would just be nice to have everything on the same place and have some real time report. This application aims to allow that and generate **real time summary for expenses and nutrition** before checking out. It would be healthier and more budget friendly. Even though it might not be realistic to carry around a laptop and use the application in real time. It can prepare for the transformation to application on phones. It would also be great tool itself for us to **keep track of expenses and nutrition after shopping so we can adjust and balance nutrition next time**.
